# Functional Programming 101

# Recursion

- Things defined in terms of themselves

- Closely related to mathematical induction

# Two main types

- Structural recursion

    - break input up into substructures & process them recursively
    - "The length of a chain is one more than the length of the chain with the first link removed.  An empty chain has length 0"


- Generative
    - create new data, then process it recursively
    - "to sort a list, partition it into two sublists - one containing everything bigger than the first element, and one containing everything smaller.  Sort those new lists, then concatenate them."

# Algebraic Data Types
- Seen mostly in ML descendants like Haskell or F#.
- A tagged union of structs
```
-- Notice: this is a recursive definition of a tree
data Tree a =
    Node {left :: Tree a, right :: Tree a, value :: a}
  | Leaf
```

# Structural recursion on a Tree:
```
size Leaf = 0
size (Node left right value) = size left + size right + 1

sum Leaf = 0
sum (Node left right value) = sum left + sum right + value

insert x Leaf = Node Leaf Leaf x
insert x (Node left right value) =
  if x > value
    then Node left (insert x right) value
    else Node (insert x left) right value

find x Leaf = False
find x (Node left right value) = case compare x value of
  Eq -> True
  Lt -> find x left
  Gt -> find x right

```

# Structural recursion on numbers
```
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)

fibonacci 0 = 1
fibonacci 1 = 1
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)
```

---
# Tail call optimization

If a function's return value is of the form `return foo(x, y, z)`

It doesn't actually have to allocate a new stack frame for the call to foo; it can jump straight to foo
This is faster and prevents StackOverflowExceptions

Not all languages implement Tail Call Optimization because it makes stack traces less useful.

---

# Structural recursion on numbers, revisited with tail calls:
```
factorial n = go n 1
  where
    go 0 acc = acc
    go n acc = go (n - 1) (acc * n)
