# Functional Programming 101 
## Week 1

Elliot Stern

---

# What is functional programming?
 
--

- programming with functions as the basic building block, instead of procedures or objects.
- Note: While in Object-oriented programming, "everything is an object", it's not the case in functional or procedural programming that "everything is a function" or "everything is a procedure"

---

# What's a function?
 
--

- A function is a pure mapping from inputs to outputs

![example function](https://www.ontrack-media.net/algebra1/a1m1l3image9.jpg)

- No:
    - manipulating memory
    - sending data over the wire
    - displaying something to the screen what's on the screen

---

# Brief History

- 1936: Lambda Calculus
- 1958: LISP
- 1973: ML
- 1990: Haskell
- 2005: F#
- 2004: Scala

Many multiparadigm languages with functional influences: Python, Ruby, Javascript, Scala, F#, C#, Rust.

# Referential Transparency

- an expression is pure or "referentially transparent" if it can be replaced with the value it evaluates to without changing the semantics at all

---
# Referentially transparent expressions
```
1 + 1
[1,2,3](1)
(new Date('2019-06-29T03:24:00')).getDay // gets the day of the week that June 29th occurred on
```
---

# Not referentially transparent
```
 x = 5;
 x++;
 foo.setBar(bar);
 log("hello world");
```

---

# How do we write referentially transparent code?
* immutability
* explicitly passed state
* recursion
* first-class functions
