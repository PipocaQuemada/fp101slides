# Functional Programming 101
## Week 1

Elliot Stern

---

# What is functional programming?

--

- Programming with functions as the basic building block, instead of procedures or objects.
- Note: While in Object-oriented programming, "everything is an object", it's not the case in functional or procedural programming that "everything is a function" or "everything is a procedure"


---

# What's a function?

--

- A function is a pure mapping from inputs to outputs

![example function](https://www.ontrack-media.net/algebra1/a1m1l3image9.jpg)

- No:
    - Manipulating memory
    - Sending data over the wire
    - Displaying something to the screen

---

# Brief History

- 1936: Lambda Calculus
- 1958: LISP
- 1973: ML
- 1990: Haskell
- 2005: F#
- 2004: Scala

Many multiparadigm languages with functional influences: Python, Ruby, Javascript, Scala, F#, C#, Rust.
---

# Referential Transparency

- An expression is pure or "referentially transparent" if it can be replaced with the value it evaluates to without changing the semantics at all

---
# Is it referentially transparent?
```
1 + 1

(new Date('2019-06-29T03:24:00')).getDay // gets the day of the week that June 29th occurred on

x = 5;

{1,2,3}[1]

x++;

foo.setBar(bar);

log("hello world");

def sum(list):
    i = 0
    for item in list:
      i += item
    i
```

---

# How do we write referentially transparent code?
* Immutability
* Explicitly passed "state"
* Recursion
* First-class functions
* Push effects to the edge of your code

Additionally, functional languages often have:
* Expression-oriented syntax
* Type inference
* Algebraic data types
* No nulls

---

```scala
sealed trait Color
case object Black extends Color
case object White extends Color

case class Player(color: Color, name: String, avatar: Image)

// Expression oriented switch expression
// Note: colorHex is an immutable val
val colorHex = player.color match {
    case Black => "#000000"
    case White => "#FFFFFF"
  }

// statement oriented switch statement
// Note: colorHex can't be immutable anymore.
var colorHex = null;
player.color match {
  case Black => colorHex = "#000000"
  case White => colorHex = "#FFFFFF"
}

```
---
# Push effects to the edge of your code; pass state explicitly

```java

interface Game<State> {
  State getInitialState();
  Picture render(State currentState);
  State processInput(UserInput input, State currentState);
  State stepWorld(int elapsedMillis, State currentState);
}

class MyGameState {
  Map<Location, Monster> monsters;
  Map<Location, ItemList> worldItems;
  ItemList inventory;
  Stats herosStats;
  Int health
  ...
}

```
---

# Why bother?

* Testability
* Local reasoning
* Compositionality
* Less buggy code
  - No fencepost errors in loops
  - No Null Pointer Exceptions in Haskell
* Concision
* Easy Refactoring
* Optimizability
  - Trivial loop fusion
  - Trivial memoization
  - Trivial parallelization
  - Partial evaluation

---

# Pure functional programming

* _Everything_ is referentially transparent
* Allows "equational reasoning"
    - Manipulate programs like equations in algebra class
    - ability to replace function with function definition
* More complex
    - need to play some rhetorical tricks to turn side-effects into pure effects
* Haskell, Elm, Clean, Miranda, Coq, Idris, Agda


---

# Impure functional programming

* _Some_ things are referentially transparent
* Up to programmer to remember what stuff is and isn't pure
* Simple - dates back to 1958

* Typically: core logic is wholly functional, with imperative shell that interacts with the real world
